# Web Development 101

The goal of this repository is to introduce people to web development. It will start with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then move on to more advanced topics such as backend development with Node.js, database management with SQLite, and more.

## Setup

To set up the project, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. This will install all the dependencies required for the project.

Then, run `npm start` to start the server. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the project in action.
